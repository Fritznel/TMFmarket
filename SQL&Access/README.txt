Dear Collaborators,

In this folder you'll find the corresponding database to typo3 TMFmarket.
You have have to create in your LOCAL database-managing system a new database called cangemarket
without any contents and then import the cangemarket.sql file.

The accessfile is a basic database that we have to put into mysql queries
Relationships and requests have to be developped.

Hope on your collaboration, wish you success by developping the interfaceandfor a
simple e-shop !

Best regards,
Your developper TIJE
